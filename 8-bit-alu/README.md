# 8-bit ALU
## Summary

This module is a continuation of my 2-bit ALU.
[Here's a link to the module and a testbench on EDA Playground.](https://www.edaplayground.com/x/gqr8)

*This module is not complete yet.*

Features include:
 - 8-bit I/O
 - 5-bit instruction register (only 4 bits used right now, but support exists for more)

Supported Operations:
00000 - n/a; IDLE
00001 - OR
00010 - AND
00011 - ADDITION
00100 - SUBTRACTION
00101 - XOR
00110 - NOR
00111 - NAND
01000 - LOGICAL SHIFT LEFT
01001 - LOGICAL SHIFT RIGHT
01010 - ROTATE LEFT
01011 - ROTATE RIGHT
01100 - COMPLEMENT (1's Complement for Unary Operation)
01101 - INCREMENT (Unary Operation, i.e., A + 1)
01110 - DECREMENT (Unary Operation, i.e., A - 1)
01111 - SET LESS THAN (Comparison, sets output to 1 if A < B, 0 otherwise)
